# Its All About Graphs
This project is an implementation of graph and tree data structures in Java, without using any built-in data structures such as arrays or lists. Instead, I implemented these data structures using pointers. In addition, I implemented the search algorithms BFS and DFS using SCC.

This project showcases my ability to implement complex data structures and algorithms from scratch, as well as my understanding of pointers and their use in Java. It also demonstrates my knowledge of fundamental graph theory concepts, such as SCC and search algorithms. Overall, this project serves as a solid foundation for further study of graph theory and related fields.
